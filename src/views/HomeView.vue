  <p class="w-50 text-center">This project relies on usage stats data pulled from <a class="link-light link-opacity-100-hover" href="https://smogon.com/stats">Smogon's official usage stats page.</a> These stats are pulled from battle data on <a class="link-opacity-100-hover link-light" href="https://play.pokemonshowdown.com">Pokémon Showdown</a>, an unofficial competitive Pokémon battle simulator developed by a team of users at Smogon.</p>
  <p class="w-50 text-center">All data belongs to Smogon.com and this project is not affiliated with Smogon, Nintendo, GameFreak or Pokémon in any way. Pokémon and Pokémon character names are trademarks of Nintendo.</p>
