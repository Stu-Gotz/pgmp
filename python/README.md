# About
This is the set of python scripts (and resulting data) that runs the back-end collection for the corresponding Vue application in the parent directory. All data is collected from Smogon's usage statistics, found at [this URL](https://www.smogon.com/stats/). Requests are made using the request library by appending a base URL with matching URLs of stats data. This data is parsed from plaintext into a CSV files, stored locally and sent to a SQL database, to have a rolling 3 months of available stats data. `smogon_pull.py` uses `_utils.py`'s helper functions to parse the data after iterating over the URLs. `DBManager.py`'s `SQLManager` class controls the SQL database data flow. `db_updater.py` is run by a scheduled task in windows to call the aforementioned and update the data on the 5th of every month.
