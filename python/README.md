This is the python scripts that manage the data collection and storage. All scripts are in the `scripts` folder, `_utils.py` contains an array of helper functions
to keep the main `smogon_pull.py` script a bit neater. `DBManager.py` does what it says on the tin, it manages the SQL database controlling update and creation (for initial startup) of tables and databases. `db_updater.py` calls both `smogon_pull.py` and `DBManager.py`, once a month via a scheduled task.
